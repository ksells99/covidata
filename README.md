It features a dashboard showing case and death for the past 24 hours, along with more detailed breakdowns including intuitive Chart.js bar graphs showing data for the last 90 days.

It also includes regional breakdowns, where users can search for their region and view the latest case/death data.

Styling is handled via Tailwind CSS (this was my first project to use it).
